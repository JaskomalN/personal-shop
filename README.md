# About
As someone who loves shopping for clothes, and fashion in general, I realized that over-consumption of clothing may not be the most sustainable. To combat this, I wanted to start selling some of my used (and very much loved) clothing items/shoes/jewelry/anything fashion related. Rather than using a third party service, I wanted to create something of my own, to deliver the most personalized shopping experience possible.

I also wanted to be able to update, add to, and remove inventory in real-time, in order to ensure the contents of my site are always accurate. So, I made sure to implement complete CRUD functionality to my storefront, allowing me to always reflect my current inventory accurately.

# Adding an Item
Adding an item to the storefront is super easy!

Here you can see the "add item" form, populated with the information needed to add a new item:

Now, you can see that the new item has been added along with the rest!

# Updating an Item
I wanted to be able to make any changes or updates to an item very easily. Here you can see the populated information form pop up, after I click "Update" on the yellow dress, with the price updated to $20, instead of $15:

As you can see, this has updated the price of the yellow dress!

# Removing an Item
In the case that an item gets sold, or I no longer want to sell it, I also wanted to be able to easily remove an item from the website. By clicking the "Remove" button on the brown sneakers, I can remove them:

This takes the user back to the "shop" page with all the items, which reflects the removal of the brown sneakers.
